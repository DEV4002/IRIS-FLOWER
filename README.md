Developed a machine learning model to classify iris flowers into three species: Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica. Utilized the famous Iris dataset, which includes features such as sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width. Implemented a Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm to achieve high accuracy in classification. The project involved data preprocessing, feature selection, model training, and evaluation. Achieved an accuracy of 95% on the test dataset, demonstrating the modelâ€™s effectiveness in distinguishing between the three species. This project enhanced my skills in Python, data analysis, and machine learning.
